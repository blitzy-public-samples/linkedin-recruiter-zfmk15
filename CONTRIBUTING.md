## Development Workflow

### Environment Setup

1. Required Software Versions:
   - Node.js: 18.x
   - Python: 3.11
   - Java: 17
   - Docker: 24.x

2. Code Quality Tools:
   - ESLint (v8.45+) with `.eslintrc.ts` configuration
   - Prettier (v3.0+) with `.prettierrc` configuration

3. Setup Commands:
```bash
# Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm install

# Python services setup
cd services/search
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Java service setup
cd services/data
./mvnw clean install
```

### Branch Strategy

1. Main Branches:
   - `main`: Production code
   - `staging`: Pre-production testing
   - `development`: Active development

2. Feature Development:
   - Create from: `development`
   - Format: `feature/description-of-feature`
   - Example: `feature/linkedin-profile-scraper`

3. Bug Fixes:
   - Format: `bugfix/description-of-fix`
   - Hotfixes: `hotfix/critical-issue-description`

4. Branch Protection Rules:
   - `main` branch requirements:
     - 2 required reviewers
     - Passing status checks: test, build, security-scan, lint
     - Squash merge strategy

### Commit Standards

1. Format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

2. Types:
   - feat: New feature
   - fix: Bug fix
   - docs: Documentation
   - style: Formatting
   - refactor: Code restructuring
   - test: Test addition/modification
   - chore: Maintenance tasks

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

1. Documentation:
   - All public APIs must have JSDoc/docstring documentation
   - Complex algorithms require detailed inline comments
   - Update README.md for significant changes

2. Code Style:
   - Use TypeScript for frontend and API Gateway
   - Follow PEP 8 for Python code
   - Follow Google Java Style Guide

### Testing Requirements

1. Coverage Thresholds:
   - Frontend/API Gateway (Jest): 80%
   - Python Services (PyTest): 85%
   - Java Services (JUnit): 85%

2. Test Categories:
   - Unit tests: Required for all new code
   - Integration tests: Required for API changes
   - Performance tests: Required for data processing changes

## Security Requirements

### Security Review Checklist

1. Code Changes:
   - [ ] No sensitive data in logs
   - [ ] Input validation implemented
   - [ ] Authentication/authorization checks
   - [ ] SQL injection prevention
   - [ ] XSS protection measures

2. Security Scanning:
   - Required: Snyk security scan
   - Required: SonarQube analysis
   - Required: Container image scanning

### Review Requirements

1. Mandatory Reviewers:
   - Security changes: @security-team
   - Backend changes: @backend-team, @tech-leads
   - Frontend changes: @frontend-team
   - Infrastructure changes: @devops-team

2. Review Process:
   - Minimum 2 reviewers required
   - Security team approval for auth changes
   - DevOps team approval for infrastructure changes

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing

1. Requirements:
   - Test file location: Same directory as source
   - Naming convention: `*.test.ts`, `*_test.py`, `*Test.java`
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

2. Integration Testing:
   - API contract testing required
   - Database integration testing required
   - External service mocking required

### Performance Testing

1. Thresholds:
   - API response time: < 200ms
   - Search operation: < 2s
   - Analysis operation: < 5s
   - Database queries: < 100ms

## Deployment Process

### Environment Stages

1. Development:
   - Automatic deployment from `development` branch
   - Feature flags required for new features
   - Monitoring and logging enabled

2. Staging:
   - Deployment after QA approval
   - Full integration testing required
   - Performance testing required
   - Security scanning required

3. Production:
   - Blue-Green deployment strategy
   - Rollback plan required
   - Monitoring alerts configured
   - Performance baseline established

### Deployment Checklist

1. Pre-deployment:
   - [ ] All tests passing
   - [ ] Security scan completed
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Release notes prepared
   - [ ] Rollback plan documented

2. Post-deployment:
   - [ ] Monitor error rates
   - [ ] Verify metrics and alerts
   - [ ] Validate feature flags
   - [ ] Update status page

### Monitoring Requirements

1. Required Metrics:
   - Application performance
   - Error rates
   - API response times
   - Resource utilization
   - Business metrics

2. Alert Thresholds:
   - Error rate: > 1%
   - Response time: > 500ms
   - CPU usage: > 80%
   - Memory usage: > 85%
